# RUL__ANNs

## Unified framework for remaining useful lifetime prediction of li-ion batteries using diverse neural networks
This repository contains code that implements a framework designed for diverse Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architectures. While it includes a comprehensive range of functionalities, such as hyperparameter optimization, dataset partitioning, and predictions using pre-trained models, it also offers tools for statistical analysis, model comparisons, and an in-depth examination of dataset partitioning.
